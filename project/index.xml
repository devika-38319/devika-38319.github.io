      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration For this project I decided to look at some interesting datasets pertaining to countries. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the year 2019 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher.</description>

      <description>Question 0
This dataset contains 390 observations of 18 variables one of which is diabetes status. Sixty patients out of 390 were found to be diabetic. Some of the other &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; variables include Glucose, Chol/HDL ratio (the lower the healthier), Age, Gender, Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, and Waist/hip ratio (the lower the usually healthier). First, we will see if any of the numeric variables show a mean difference across Gender.</description>
